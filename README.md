# rollerskatespotsaus.github.io
A site to discover community-submitted rollerskating spots in your australian neighbourhood!

## about the project
This project was created out of the need for a site that lists great places to skate in Australia. It also doubles as a fun and exciting project for <a href="https://github.com/CelineLind">CelineLind</a> to practice building a website from scratch.

## future improvements
With the functionality of the site working and for the most part abiding by good web development principles (such as information being less than 3 clicks away), the UI and UX are set to be improved. Through this, navigating and using the site will become easier and information will be displayed more effectively.
